	social networks formed by social interactions like co-authoring, advising, supervising, and serving on committees between academics; 

	 - Degree Centrality: measure of how often an author collaborates with other authors in the network. 
	 - Eigenvector Centrality: depends on the quality of connections nodes with higher eigenvector centrality lie at the centre of flow of ideas and information in the network.
	 In co-authorships networs it represents the author's ability to receive new research ideas
	 -  Betweenness Centrality: nodes with high betweenness centrality occupy strategic positions in the network. 重要地位
	 - Closeness centrality: diversity of the connections
	 - Clustering co-efficient: prediction of future collaborations
	 - Average Degree: measure of how collaborative 
	 - Density: the degree of collaboration in the network
