	social networks formed by social interactions like co-authoring, advising, supervising, and serving on committees between academics; 

	 - Degree Centrality: measure of how often an author collaborates with other authors in the network. 
	 - Eigenvector Centrality: depends on the quality of connections nodes with higher eigenvector centrality lie at the centre of flow of ideas and information in the network.
	 In co-authorships networs it represents the author's ability to receive new research ideas
	 -  Betweenness Centrality: nodes with high betweenness centrality occupy strategic positions in the network. 重要地位
	 - Closeness centrality: diversity of the connections
	 - Clustering co-efficient: prediction of future collaborations
	 - Average Degree: measure of how collaborative 
	 - Density: the degree of collaboration in the network

 **objective:** the factor that influence the the start position in academic job market (granted with phD program)
 **data sources:** individual's CV on academia.edu, fields(names, subfield, PhD institution, year of doctorate, and country that grants phD)
 **methods and results**: 
	 - ***SNA:*** 
		 - Density. reciprocity, centrality, coresness and GINI coefficient 
		 - Reciprocity: 10% symmetrical ties e.g. Chicago, Harvard, Berkeley, Michigan output > input
		 - Centrality:
				 - degree centrality: Michigan <=> diverse programs than Chicago and Harvard
				 - betweeness centrality: Michigan, Arizona as bridge to other university program 
				 - eigenvector centrality: Chicago, Michigan and Harvard 
				 - core-Periphery Structure (coreness): 
	 - ***Statistical analysis:*** 
		 - ***Objective:*** identify the influence of productivity, prestige and institutional resources on the nmber of faculty  
		 - active graduate student; ranking; mean publications per faculty member; mean citations, mean awards GRE scores, university endowment, ranking in hiring dynamics
		 - ***Results:***  universities with large endowments and have faculty who hold prestigious awards and are widely cited by other scholars
